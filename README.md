# CodeChallenge - Date 10/14/2018
This git is a repsonse to Code challenge received on 10/12/2018

The requirements of the code challenge are in the [pdf file](https://github.com/Ever-Flows/CodeChallenge/blob/master/Automation%20Code%20Challenge%20ver%205%5B2%5D.pdf) in this repository. 

# Setup
Assumption 
* **Anaconda is installed** - on MAC type - brew install conda

# Steps for setup
No new modules need to be installed
* **Create codech environment** type in terminal window: conda create -n codech python=3.6
* **Activate environment** type in terminal window: source activate codech
* **Check modules** - Compare with modules in modules.txt

# Usage
* *python codech.py* runs the code and meets all requirements outlined in the requirements pdf files.
* *python codech.py debug* helps with the debug by printing different steps

# Other Files
* **clearfiles.sh** for MAC - executing this shell script deletes all files and sub-folders to allow running the codech.py program again
