# CodeChallenge - Date 10/14/2018
This git is a repsonse to Code challenge

# Requirements
The requirements of the code challenge are in the [pdf file](https://github.com/Ever-Flows/CodeChallenge/blob/master/clearfiles.sh) in the directory. 

# Setup
Assumption 
* **Anaconda is installed** On MAC - brew install conda

#Steps for setup
No new modules need to be installed
* **Create codech environment** conda create -n codech python=3.6
* **Activate environment** source activate codech
* **Check modules** Compare with modules in modules.txt

# Usage
* *python codech.py* runs the code and meets all requirements outlined in the requireemnts pdf files.
* *python codech.py debug* helps with the debug by printing different steps

# Other Files
* **clearfiles.sh** for MAC - executing this shell script deletes all files and sub-folders to allow running the codech.py program again

# Test environment
* On Apple Mac
